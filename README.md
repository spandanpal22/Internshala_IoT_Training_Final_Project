Using this we can  predict the temperature and also detect any anomaly in the temperature of a 
refrigerator or any other place using Machine Learning and Internet of Things
<br/><br/>
This project uses Machine Learning and Internet of Things to predict the future temperature and it also detects any 
anomaly in the temperature data using Z-Score Analysis and sends an Email and SMS alert to the user.
<br/><br/>
We could have used simple if-else statements to detect any anomaly in the data but the temperature is not always 
constant it can fluctuate inside a refrigerator but we are interested in only sudden changes then we can use Machine Learning,
here we used Z-Score Analysis to figure out the anomaly in the temperature data set more effectively.
<br/><br/>
Python(we will be using Python 3 here) pakacges required can be downloaded by writing the following commands in the terminal:
- pip3 install boltiot
